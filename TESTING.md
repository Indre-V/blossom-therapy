## Responsiveness Tests

To test the responsiveness, I have launched the websiteÂ very early on. I followed the mobile-first strategy and verified all of my modifications using the DevTools browsers for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. Deployed versions were tested using the external website [Responsive Design Checker](https://responsivedesignchecker.com/ "Responsive Design Checker"). The [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive "Am I responsive") website was another external source that was used to obtain a unified view of different device breakpoints.

I have also used Google Chrome's Mobile Simulator extension to evaluate the responsiveness of even more specialized devices. Device samples were examined for navigation, element alignment, content layout, and functionality concerns at different breakpoints.

Final Test Results:

| Size | Device Example     | Navigation | Element Alignments | Content Placement | Functionality | Notes                                             |

## Code Validation

### HTML

### CSS

### JavaScript

### Python

The python files have all been passed through [PEP8 CI Online](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)

<details><summary><b>PEP8 Test Results</b></summary>

**run.py:**

![run.py](docs/pep8-run-py-result.png)

</details><br/>

## Automated Testing



### Python (Unit Testing)

I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal:

`python manage.py test`

## Defensive Programming Testing

Defensive programming testing involves verifying that the defensive measures implemented in the code are effective. 


- Negative Testing: Provide invalid or unexpected inputs to the application to see how well it handles errors and exceptions.

### Role-based restrictions

## Bugs Fixed

## Browser Compatibility

The deployed project was tested on the most popular browsers for compatibility issues.

| Browser | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome | ![screenshot](/readme/docs/chrome.png) | Works as expected |
| Firefox | ![screenshot](/readme/docs/firefox.png) | Works as expected |
| Edge | ![screenshot](/readme/docs//edge.png) | Works as expected |


## User Story Testing

## Lighthouse Testing

Blossom-Therapy was tested in the [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) and [Microsoft Edge Dev Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/open/?tabs=cmd-Windows) using Lighthouse Testing tool which inspects and scores the website for the following criteria:

* Performance - how quickly a website loads and how quickly users can access it.
* Accessibility - test analyses how well people who use assistive technologies can use your website.
* Best Practices - checks whether the page is built on the modern standards of web development.
* SEO - checks if the website is optimised for search engine result rankings.

Initial Lighthouse tests returned an error *Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio.*. This was due to the button font in the Profile Section. Once the font was updated, the Accessibility score returned 100.

## Accessibility Testing

[WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) online tool was used to check terminal colour contrast.

While building the application, the general principles of accessibility where adhered to: 

- Using clear instructions
- Asking for user input before continuing
- Validating inputs before moving on to the next step
- Testing the game to make sure it does not crash from user input
- Using ARIA labels in the README
