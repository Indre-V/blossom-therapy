## Design Choices

### Typography

 [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather?query=merri) was chosen as the primary font to enhance the reading experience and align with the blog's nature-themed aesthetic. Its design features make it highly legible on both screens and printed materials, which is crucial for ensuring that readers can comfortably engage with the content, whether they are viewing detailed plant care guides or inspirational gardening stories.This font's traditional yet modern feel complements the natural, earthy tones of our color palette, creating a cohesive and inviting atmosphere that reflects the beauty and tranquility of gardening. By using Merriweather, I aim to deliver content that is not only visually appealing but also easy to read, thereby enhancing the overall user experience.

### Colour Scheme

This color scheme aims to create a harmonious balance between the vibrant, nature-inspired elements of the gardening insights and the professional, reliable tone needed for the developer section. By combining these carefully chosen colors, I aim to deliver a visually appealing and user-friendly experience that resonates with both gardeners and potential customers.

| Color | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Primary Color:** | Tomato (#FF6347) |
| | Tomato is a warm, energetic color that evokes the vitality and freshness of a garden in full bloom. Its boldness grabs attention, making it perfect for call-to-action buttons and important highlights. This lively hue reflects the passion and enthusiasm of gardening enthusiasts, adding a sense of excitement to the blog. |
| **Secondary Color:** | Steel Blue (#4682B4) |
| | Steel Blue provides a calming and reliable counterpoint to the vibrant primary color. It symbolizes trust, stability, and depth, making it an ideal choice for the developer section, where clarity and reliability are paramount. This color helps create a serene environment that encourages focus and productivity. |
| **Accent Color:** | Gold (#FFD700) |
| | Gold is used as an accent color to add a touch of elegance and sophistication. It represents achievement and high quality, which can enhance the perceived value of the content. Gold is versatile and works well for highlighting key information, links, and decorative elements, providing a cohesive look across both sections of the site. |
| **Supporting Colors:** | |
| | **Peach Puff (#FFDAB9):** This soft, warm color complements the primary color, creating a gentle and inviting atmosphere. It can be used for backgrounds, secondary buttons, and subtle highlights, enhancing the site's overall warmth and friendliness. |
| | **Powder Blue (#B0E0E6):** A lighter shade of blue, Powder Blue provides a refreshing and airy feel. It is perfect for background elements and less critical components, maintaining the site's clean and spacious look without overwhelming the user. |
| | **Ivory (#FFFFF0):** Ivory is used as an alternative background color to add warmth and softness. It can be applied to sections that need a gentle, neutral backdrop, ensuring that the content remains the focal point. |
| **Background and Text Colors:** | |
| | **Background Color:** White (#ffffff): White serves as the main background color, offering a clean, minimalist canvas that enhances readability and makes other colors stand out. |
| | **Text Color:** Dark Gray (#222020): Dark Gray is chosen for the text color due to its excellent legibility and modern appearance. It provides a strong contrast against the white background, ensuring that the text is easy to read without being as stark as black. |

### Images

Combination of images sourced from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), [Gencraft](https://gencraft.com/ "Gencraft"), and those taken by the developer contributes to a visually compelling and cohesive website design that effectively communicates the message and values of the gardening blog and developer section.

### Responsiveness

My website is responsive to different layouts depending on the size of the viewport have been included in the CSS media queries. This allows visitors to experience the website as I intended on device types and screen sizes. The breakpoints I am using are from Bootstrap.
